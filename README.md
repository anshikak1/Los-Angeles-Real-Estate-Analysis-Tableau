**Real Estate Housing Data â€“ Los Angeles**  
I have built a dashboard showcasing Real Estate housing data for Los Angeles County in California.

**Built With**:  
Tableau Desktop: For crafting visually engaging and interactive data stories.  
Python: Employed for automating data scraping and preprocessing tasks.

The primary objectives of this Data Visualization project are:
- **Price Patterns**: Look at how house prices behave in LA County. Figure out what makes prices go up or down.
- **Amenities Impact**: Check out how the cool stuff in a house, like a pool or gym, affects the price. See if having these things makes houses more expensive.
- **Geographical Distribution**: See where the pricey houses are on a map. Find out which neighborhoods have the most expensive homes.
- **Interactive Exploration**: I've made a cool dashboard that lets you play around with the data. You can filter and dig deep into specific details about the real estate scene in LA County.

To understand the housing price effectively, I have used multiple different visualizations like:
- Line Chary
- Map 
- Bar Chart
- Tree Map
- Packed Bubbles chart
- Heat Map  

Below is how the dashboard looks:

Temporal Trends: A timeline of daily average house sales prices capturing the ebb and flow of the market.  
Geospatial Insights: A color-coded map reflecting the average sale price of homes, providing a geographical perspective on market hotspots.  
Price and Condition Analysis: A comprehensive heat map displaying the intersection of property conditions and their value.  
Market Distribution Metrics: Histograms highlighting the distribution of house prices, bedrooms, and bathrooms, offering a granular look at property features. 

My dashboard provides a clear overview of Los Angeles County's housing sales, revealing market trends, the impact of amenities on prices, and the distribution of high-value homes. It's a comprehensive tool for understanding LA's real estate landscape.
