**Real Estate Housing Data â€“ Los Angeles**

The primary objectives of this Data Visualization project are:
**Price Patterns**: Look at how house prices behave in LA County. Figure out what makes prices go up or down.
**Amenities Impact**: Check out how the cool stuff in a house, like a pool or gym, affects the price. See if having these things makes houses more expensive.
**Geographical Distribution**: See where the pricey houses are on a map. Find out which neighborhoods have the most expensive homes.
**Interactive Exploration**: I've made a cool dashboard that lets you play around with the data. You can filter and dig deep into specific details about the real estate scene in LA County.

To understand the housing price effectively, I have used multiple different visualizations like:
1. Line Chary
2. Map 
3. Bar Chart
4. Tree Map
5. Packed Bubbles chart
6. Heat Map

Below is how the dashboard looks:
